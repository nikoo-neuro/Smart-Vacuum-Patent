This repository contains the official documentation for my second registered patent:

Title: Smart Vacuum Electronic Splint with the Ability to Coagulate and Control Blood Supply

This invention introduces a medical device that uses smart vacuum technology to help stop bleeding (coagulation) and regulate blood supply during or after injuries. The system includes a vacuum-based splint that can be used in emergency medical situations to quickly stabilize blood flow, reduce bleeding, and promote healing.

It is particularly useful in field emergencies, ambulances, and combat situations where time is critical and traditional wound care might be limited.
